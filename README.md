# SoilSpec4All

Over the past few decades, soil spectral libraries (SSLs) have been created on scales ranging from local farms to the entire globe using visible-near-infrared (Vis-NIR) sensors. As the availability of affordable, portable, and miniaturised NIR sensors with specific wavelength ranges increases, we are keen to investigate their effectiveness in estimating soil properties.

However, due to variations in technical specifications such as spectral resolution, range, and energy intensity, different NIR sensors may yield varying performances. This necessitates the normalisation of the spectral information retrieved from different sensors, enabling end-users and researchers to expand soil testing services within a more manageable budget.

In this context, we are working on a mathematical function to normalise the spectral data obtained from the cost-effective NIRvascan Portable Smart Spectrometer (https://www.alliedscientificpro.com/nirvascan). The aim is to make it comparable to the data from the research-grade spectral ASD - AgriSpec sensor. Our goal is to build a reliable model that can predict the levels of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus in any type of soil using a miniaturised NIR sensor.

This approach will facilitate more efficient, regular, and current soil information on soil properties at affordable costs. It will aid in the implementation of policies for sustainable agriculture and natural resource management.
