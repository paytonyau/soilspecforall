# SoilSpec4All

Soil spectral libraries (SSLs) have been developed over the past decades from farm to global scales using visible-near-infrared (Vis-NIR) sensors. With the increasing number of low-cost, portable, and miniaturised NIR sensors with specific wavelength ranges, we are interested in exploring the efficiency of those sensors in estimating soil properties. However, different NIR sensors can achieve diverse performances due to differences in technical specifications like spectral resolution, range, and energy intensity. Therefore, there is a need to normalise the retrieved spectral information between different sensors, which will allow end-users and researchers to expand soil testing services at a lower investment and budget. Here, we are developing a mathematical function to normalise the spectral data from two different NIR sensors and build a reliable model to predict carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus in any type of soils using a miniaturised NIR sensor. This will provide more efficient, periodic, and up-to-date soil information on soil properties at accessible costs for implementing policies for sustainable agriculture and natural resource management.
