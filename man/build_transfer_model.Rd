\title{Build a Spectral Transfer Model}
\usage{
build_transfer_model(source_spectra, target_spectra, method = "pds", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{source_spectra}{A numeric matrix of spectra from the source instrument
(samples as rows).}

\item{target_spectra}{A numeric matrix of spectra from the target instrument.
Must have the same dimensions and sample order as `source_spectra`.}

\item{method}{The transfer method to use. Can be either `"pds"` (the default)
or `"subtraction"`.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to the specific method. For PDS, these
are `n_components` and `window_size`. For Subtraction, this is `outlier_wl`
(the wavelength used for outlier detection).}
}
\value{
A `transfer_model` object containing the necessary components to apply
  the transfer to new data.
}
\description{
Creates a model to transfer spectra from a source instrument (e.g., low-cost)
to match a target instrument (e.g., high-end). Supports Piecewise Direct
Standardization (PDS) and Subtraction methods.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Build a PDS model with 2 components and a window size of 5
pds_model <- build_transfer_model(isc_spectra, asd_spectra, method = "pds",
                                  n_components = 2, window_size = 5)

# Build a Subtraction model, using wavelength 1415 for outlier removal
sub_model <- build_transfer_model(isc_spectra, asd_spectra, method = "subtraction",
                                  outlier_wl = "1415")
}
