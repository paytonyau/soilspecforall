\title{Apply Splice Correction to ASD Spectra}
\usage{
correct_splice(spectra, wavelengths, splice_points, interpol_bands = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{spectra}{A numeric matrix or data frame of spectra (samples as rows,
wavelengths as columns).}

\item{wavelengths}{A numeric vector of the corresponding wavelengths.}

\item{splice_points}{A numeric vector indicating the wavelengths where
detectors are joined (e.g., `c(1000, 1800)`).}

\item{interpol_bands}{The number of bands to use for interpolation around the
splice points. Defaults to 10.}
}
\value{
A matrix with the splice-corrected spectra.
}
\description{
Corrects for instrumental artifacts at detector joins in ASD spectra. This
function is a wrapper around `prospectr::spliceCorrection`.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Assuming 'asd_spectra' is a matrix and 'wavs' is a vector of wavelengths
corrected_spectra <- correct_splice(asd_spectra, wavs, splice_points = c(1000, 1800))
}
