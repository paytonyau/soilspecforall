\title{Apply a Spectral Transfer Model}
\usage{
apply_transfer(new_source_spectra, transfer_model)
}
\arguments{
\item{new_source_spectra}{A numeric matrix of new spectra from the source
instrument.}

\item{transfer_model}{A `transfer_model` object created by the
`build_transfer_model` function.}
}
\value{
A matrix containing the transformed spectra.
}
\description{
Applies a pre-built transfer model to new source spectra to make them match
the target instrument's characteristics.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Assuming 'pds_model' was built earlier
corrected_new_spectra <- apply_transfer(new_isc_samples, pds_model)
}
