Title: A Feasible and Low-Cost Approach for Environmentally Sustainable
    Analysis of Soils in Agriculture
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Payton Yau [aut, cre]

Description: Provides a complete suite of functions to normalize spectral data
    between a low-cost, portable spectrometer (ISC NIRvascan) and a
    high-end, laboratory instrument (ASD AgriSpec). This package implements
    a full workflow including data import, cleaning, pre-processing
    (splice correction, smoothing, resampling, SNV), spectral transfer
    (PDS, Subtraction), and machine learning model training (PLSR, Cubist)
    to accurately predict soil properties such as Total Organic Carbon (TOC),
    Total Nitrogen (TN), and pH.
